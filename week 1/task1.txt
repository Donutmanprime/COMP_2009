Template is a feature in C++ that helps create generic functions and classes.
It enables writing of code that works with different data types without specifying them.


'Type' is a placeholder for a data type in the template. It represents a generic type 
that will be substituted with the actual data type when the template is instantiated.


The program will find the maximum and minimum values in the given arrays (intList and strList).
It will then print the maximum and minimum values for each array.

a member-wise copy of the data members from the source object to the newly created object.
